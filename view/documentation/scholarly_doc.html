                    <h3>1.1 Purpose</h3>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of this document is to give you information and guidance on
                        the implementation, functionalities and usage of
                        a service providing app that hosts different services.
                        The app stores, manipulates and displays information on the services hosted,
                        giving the users possibility to edit, view, download and responsively interact
                        with the interface in order to be able to post or book services directly from
                        the app.
                    </p>

                    <h3>1.2 Product Scope</h3>
                    <p>
                        The app is intended to grow the business and improve some areas
                        based on insider data and given statistics, as a result of information collected from its users.
                        The app will serve as an intermidiate for hosting different kind
                        of services, store and update data on business info, service providers info,
                        bookings; we give the consumers accurate information on the current disponible services,
                        trainers, free time-lots and a lot of other information, so that the customer
                        could visualize and decide what's best for him in advance.
                        <br>
                        The main admin will have access to the insider data and statics, be
                        capable of adding new employee accounts.
                        <br>
                        The human service providers will have a special account and will be able
                        to vizualize data on the company they work for.
                        The basic user will have the possibility of vizualize
                        the general information on the website and book services.
                        <br>
                        It is good to know that the app doesn't dispose any payment method. After the booking of the service,
                        the client will be given a personal code with which he/she could go to the
                        service location and pay directly from there.

                    <h3>2.2 User Classes and Characteristics</h3>
                    <p>The program was designed to be used by an average user.
                      The functionalities are easy and straightforward,
                      so it is not needed any preliminary guidance. <br>
                      <b>- Frequency of use.</b> An average user should access the site twice per week to check for updates and new services to buy. It should be your to-go app on a regular basis for standard services.
                      <br>
                      <b>- Subset of product functions used.</b> The product has basic functions like authentication, browsing, booking and reviewing. For the general user they are easy to use.
                      The statistics part is accessible only by admin, even though he should have some basic knowledge of how the system works and operates.
                      <br>
                      <b>- Education level and expirience.</b> The general user should be at least in middle school in order to use the app, whereas the admin should have working knowledge in order to operate in the statistics page.
                      <br>

                    <p>
                      This is a web-app which will be disponible
                      from any currently known web-browser(Chrome, Mozila Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari) and on any operating system which supports them(Windows, IOS, Android, Linux).

                <h3>2.4 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
                <p>
                 For our app we will use Google Charts in order to make the visual representation of the diagrams more attractive.
                 Because we will make complex diagrams of different types (pie, bar, column) and they will manipulate complex data,
                 it was decided to use this library instead of doing it from skratch.

                <h2>3. External Interface Requirements</h2>
                <section>
                    <h3>3.1 User Interfaces</h3>
                    This system would be used in a retail environment. It could be used for client side and administration side as well.

                    Also, it will be used in the condition where a client wants to view/book/review a disposed service; for the admin side - when
                    he would want to check the statistics, feedbacks and add a new employee to the system.
                    <br>
                    The full and detailed interface can be found at <b><a href="https://www.figma.com/file/Q2RfuiGgTovVFeYAezHKA4/Serp?node-id=250%3A2">this figma website link.</a></b><br><br>
                   <p> The architecture of pages is simple enough so that users won’t be
                      confused, but still focusing on the purpose of the application and the task user
                      wants to accomplishes. A header sits at the top of each page and present the app logo and page
                      titles, acting also as a navigational tool. Detailed buttons inform the user of the
                      website’s functionalities and at the same time build towards a more comfortable
                      navigation experience.
                      The application pages can be classified into three categories: public - can be viewed by anyone,
                      private - accessible only by users who have an account, these being employees and admin.
                      In turn, the private ones can be accessed as follows: each employee can view the program page
                      corresponding to the department he belongs to (massage, fitness, uber), and the admin is redirected to admin home page where he has access to
                       following pages: Statistici, Rapoarte feedback, Adauga angajat.</p>
                      <br><br>
                    <b>Main page</b><br>
                    The main page includes a descriptive header, footer, image slider and feedback form that give an insight into the app logic and functionality.
                    The user can glide through the slider images and understand the cathegories of products he will get to see and the motivation
                    behind booking those. The buttons <b>Home</b>, <b>Uber</b>, <b>Masaj</b>, <b>Fitness</b> and <b>Log in</b>
                     will redirect the user to the
                    <ul>
                      <li> html pages corresponding to the attractive visualisation of data, booking and rating pages of concrete hosted services( <b>Uber</b>, <b>Masaj</b>, <b>Fitness</b> )</li>
                      <li>login page ( <b>Log In</b> )</li>
                      <li>The main home page  ( <b>Home</b> )</li>
                    </ul>

                    You can visualize which cathegory to choose from the disponible statistics.
                    <br>
                    Initially, we have four cathegories from which we can choose ( <b>Zona</b>, <b>Serviciu</b>, <b>Pret</b>, <b>Perspectiva</b> ). By choosing the cathegory,
                    the admin gets two the next ramification, which is different for each cathegory.
                    <br> <br>
                    <b>Zona</b> could be classified by:

                    The <b>Serviciu</b> could be classified by:

                      <li>Fitness</li>
                      <li>Masaj</li>

                    The <b>Insights</b> or the <b>Perspectiva</b> page describes the overall progress and pottential of each compartiment.


                    In the example bellow we selected the <b>Fitness</b> cathegory from the 5 initial possibilities.
                    Then we channeled with the "Subscription type" or "Tip abonament" criteria and then, chose the month of the current year
                    by which the charts and statistics will be drawn - "April".
                    In this way, the user interacted with the interface and did the right selection for his necessities.
                    As a result, the corresponding charts were displayed. As you can see the charts are abailable in different forms(pie chart, bar chart, column chart)
                    <p>In the feedback page the admin can view all the received feedback, with the following
